# microservice-base
This contains my experiments and thoughts of microservices

## What to consider when I build a microservice?
Here are the list of aspects from scratch

### Architecture
* Microservice description (purpose, performance requirements, etc.)
* Web framework
* Horizontal scalability approach
* Service autodiscovery
* Frontend architecture
* Backend architecture
* Logs collection, parsing, storing, visualizing

### Development
* Test framework, fake data, mocking
* Versioning API
* SQL DB, ORM and migrations
* Logging on frontend and backend, X-Request-Id
* Queue interface
* Background jobs
* REST client
* Caching
* Code coverage metrics
* Linters
* Autogenerated developer documentation
* API documenting

### Deployment
* Host provisioning
* CI/CD
* Zero downtime deployment
* Canary testing

### Maintenance

* Monitoring availability, performance, exceptions, metrics
* Fault tolerance
* Scaling
* Config management
* backups
